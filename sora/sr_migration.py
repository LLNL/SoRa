    """Perform a ring migration between the *populations*.
       In this case, each MPI rank is expected to have 1 population.
       So the migrants just get passed to the next MPI rank.
       The migration first
       select *k* emigrants from each population using the specified *selection*
       operator and then replace *k* individuals from the associated population
       in the *migarray* by the emigrants. If no *replacement* operator is
       specified, the immigrants will replace the emigrants of the population,
       otherwise, the immigrants will replace the individuals selected by the
       *replacement* operator. The migration array, if provided, shall contain
       each population's index once and only once. If no migration array is
       provided, it defaults to a serial ring migration (1 -- 2 -- ... -- n --
       1). Selection and replacement function are called using the signature
       ``selection(populations[i], k)`` and ``replacement(populations[i], k)``.
       It is important to note that the replacement strategy must select *k*
       **different** individuals. For example, using a traditional tournament for
       replacement strategy will thus give undesirable effects, two individuals
       will most likely try to enter the same slot.
